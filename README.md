### Project Title
*Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Project 2: Explore US Bikeshare Data with Python.*

### Description
This is a **python script** that lets users explore various **metrics about bikesharing programs in three US cities**.

It asks the user for input on the **city** they want to explore, the **month** they want to filter by and the **day of the week** they are interested in.

The script takes these inputs as **filters** and outputs a series of key figures about the bikesharing program in that city, month and day.

The featured figures are: most popular month, day and hour to travel, most common start station, end station and trip, total time traveled and average trip duration, breakdown of user type, breakdown of gender, and earliest, most recent and most common year of birth.

It then asks the user if they'd want the script to display 5 rows of **raw data**, and it keeps doing so as long as the user keeps typing yes.

Finally it asks the user if they'd like to **restart** the script and, if not, the script ends.
